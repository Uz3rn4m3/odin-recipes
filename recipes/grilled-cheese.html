        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>Loaf of bread. We'll take what we need and put the rest back.</li>
            <li>Couple slices of cheese. Doesn't need to fancy. *whispers* <em>The ones with the plastic is the best!</em></li>
            <li>Butter! Just bring the whole tube. We'll eyeball it! </li>
            
        </ul>
        <div>Follow these steps to achieve culinary artist</div>
        <ol>
            <li> Put a skillet on the stove and set temp to low. Small sized flames for my gas stove users. while that is heating, take out two piece of bread. Put the rest back. Be sure to use a bread tie, don't just fold the plastic underneath. Take out butter from fridge. Get a knife-BE CAREFUL-and spread the butter, lightly, one side of the bread. Some people do both...that's a waste of butter. Pull out a couple slices of cheese. Two if you're sensible, three if you're feeling brave.</li>
            <li>Lay one bread slice butter-side down on the skillet. Then slap...delicately layer the cheese slices on to the bread. Next, lay the second slice of bread butter-side up on top of the cheese.</li>
            <li>Keep checking the underside of the sandwhich until it is at your favorite color crispy. Once golden brown and cheese is nice and gooey, take out of skillet, let cool and cut sandwhich into triangles.</li>
        </ol>
